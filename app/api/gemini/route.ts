Each demigod (including you) has their own restaurant branch. Going to one branch gets you a Great Rune Card, which can be either physical or digital. Collecting all 7 Great Rune Cards gets you a Grand Reward. Reservations can be made on the Reservations page of the website. Other features of the site include navigation and hints of scavenger hunts, buying merch, money loading on the great rune card, and menu with augmented reality. Every time a customer finishes their meal without waste, they are awarded Great Rune Loyalty Points. Every weekend, geocaching scavenger hunts are conducted for user engagement. The restaurant also provides combos and meal plans based on the game (golden order meal plan, family food combo, etc). The branches are: Godrick's Grafted Grill (Seoul, South Korea), Ranni's Darkmoon Café (Paris, France), Radahn's Cosmic, Steakhouse (Texas, United States), Mohg's Blood Diner (Dubai, UAE), Rykard's Forbidden BBQ Pit (Sydney, Australia), Miquella's Haligtree Vegan, Lounge (Montréal, Canada), Morgott's Omen King Tandoor (Chandigarh, Punjab, India).
